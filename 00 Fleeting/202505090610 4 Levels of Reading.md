# 4 Levels Reading
1. Elementary Reading: The most basic level - understanding the words and sentences on the page.
2. Inspectional Reading: Skimming or  pre-reading to get the main idea. Learn everything that the surface alone can teach you - like checking table of contents, chapter summaries, and headings.
3. Analytical Reading: Reading deeply to fully understand the book. Ask questions, look up unfamiliar ideas, and break down arguments.
4. Syntopical Reading: Reading multiple books on the same topics, comparing their ideas, and forming your own understanding that go beyond any single book.
