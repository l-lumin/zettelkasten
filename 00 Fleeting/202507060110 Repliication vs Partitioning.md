1. Replication
   - Keep a copy of the data on several different nodes
   - Provides redundancy: if some nodes are unavailable, data can still be served from remaining nodes
2. Partitioning
   - Splitting a big database into smaller subsets call _partitions_
   - Different nodes can be assigned to different nodes (also known as _sharding_)
