# Data Model

1. Relation model
    - Data is organized into relations (called tables in SQL)
    - each relation is an unordered collections of tuples (rows in SQL)
    - Emphasizes structure data and relationship through keys

2. Document model
    - Data is stored in self-contained documents (JSON, BSON)
    - Relationships between documents are rare or loosely defined
    - Common in NoSQL databases like MongoDB, suitable for semi-structured data

3. Graph model
    - Data is represented as nodes (entities) and edge (relationships)
    - Designed for scenarios where everything is potentially related to everything
    - Ideal for highly connected data, like social networks or recommendation engines
