# Qualia

#philosophy

**Qualia** (singular: _quale_) are the subjective, first-person experiences of perception - the raw "what it feels like" aspect of being conscious. [^1]

Example:
- the redness of red 
- the bitterness of coffee

Qualia are **private and non-transferable**. No one can directly access your qualia, only their own.
