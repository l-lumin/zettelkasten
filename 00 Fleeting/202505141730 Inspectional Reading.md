# Inspectional Reading

## Two types of inspectional reading

### Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
1. Look at the title page, preface
2. Study the table of contents
3. Check the index
4. Read the publisher's blurb
5. Look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument
6. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two, sometimes several pages in sequence, never more than that

### Superficial Reading
- On your first read-through, read the book from beginning to end without stopping to look up things you donâ€™t understand.
